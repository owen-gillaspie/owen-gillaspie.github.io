## Day 1: Monday
I got to Ryan's house and chopped wood, unpacked my things, and hung out.

## Day 2: Tuesday
I started building this website, and Ryan started teaching me about coding.

## Day 3: Wednesday
I played mario and slept mostly, but I also went to a Portland Thorns soccer game ([They crushed the Houston Dash.](https://www.oregonlive.com/portland-thorns/2019/07/portland-thorns-rout-houston-dash-5-0-as-us-womens-national-team-players-make-return-to-providence-park.html)) Ryan's college friend's daughter made fun of how small his phone is. Which is fair because it really is tiny. We also saw what looked like a 13 year-old girl go into a adult-accessory shop on the walk back to Ryan's truck.

## Day 4: Thursday 
Ryan and I just played a bunch of Mario 3 and actually beat it.

## Day 5: Friday
 Ryan's cousin Brian and his girlfriend, Emily, came over and we watched [Pan's Labyrinth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan%27s_Labyrinth) outside with a projector. That movie's easily one of the weirdest and creepiest ever and will forever haunt me. It was still nice to be able to be outside watching a movie with a fire and family.

## Day 6: Saturday 
My aunt Erinn, Ryan, and I went into downtown Oregon City and visited some very weird shops, things like year-round Christmas and Halloween shops. The manager of the Halloween store described it as "spooky steampunk," which was funny because it wasn't at all steampunk. As expected, Ryan brought us to a record store and took about an hour to find what he wanted. We also went up [the big elevator](https://www.orcity.org/publicworks/municipal-elevator). Ryan and I also beat Super Mario World...it was painful. 

## Day 7: Sunday
My dad, Ryan, and I plan to go to a movie, and then I'll have to leave.
