<p>Uhh so tbh I don’t really remember most of what Ryan taught me, and i don’t at all know what i’m doing, but I think it’s fine because i’m enjoying it. So basically every website’s made out of three things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<p>HTML being what things actually say on the website that you’re creating (that’s probably not right but whatever i’m trying.) CSS is sort of like the cosmetics, the word color, and other things, i can’t really remember. JavaScript is sorta what happens when you click or interact with something on the website.</p>

<p>And all of what you’re seeing has been coded on an app called Visual Studio Code. Terminal has also been useful, too. I know this all probably looks very basic and minimalistic, but that’s because well, it is. Even though it may not look like much, this website took a while to make, mainly because the whole time i’ve been completely confused. So don’t give me any crap about how this looks. But hey, I made <a href="/about">a fricken map</a>, which was very difficult.</p>
